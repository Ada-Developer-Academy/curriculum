# Ruby / RVM Installation

### Development Tools

Start by installing the following software. Each of these are easy one-click installers:

- [Xcode](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12)
- [Brew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/)
- [Textmate](http://macromates.com) or [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com) TODO: Decide which

### Install Command Line Tools (CLI)

We'll need to install the Command Line Tools from Xcode. 

- Open Xcode
- Go to `Xcode > Preferences` in the menu bar. *Protip™: ```⌘``` is a shortcut for the preferences in most applications*
- Click on the `Downloads` tab.
- Locate `Command Line Tools` in the list of Components, and click install.

### Install RVM

RVM (Ruby Version Manager) is a system to isolate and install multiple versions of ruby on the same computer. Programming languages evolve quickly, and so do the libraries written in Ruby, and every version will introduce change. One project may be dependent on Ruby 1.9.3 while another may be dependent on the features in Ruby 2.0.0. To avoid conflicts with different versions of ruby and libraries RVM isolates the installations related to each version.

- Open the `Terminal` app.
- Type `\curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash` *You will see a bunch of output*
- Open the file located at `~/.bash_profile` and add `source $HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm` to the bottom of the file. *Protip™: You can use the `echo` command in the terminal to append text to a file without opening it. `echo "source $HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" >> ~/.bash_profile`*
- To ensure RVM is installed correctly type `type rvm | head -n 1`, if everything is right it should return `rvm is a function`.

### Install Ruby 2.0.0

Use the `rvm` tool to install and use Ruby 2.0.0.

- `rvm install ruby-2.0.0`
- Wait a while... It will take a few minutes
- `rvm use 2.0.0`
- Check the version with `ruby -v`. This should read `ruby 2.0.0...`
- Next open up IRB and give 'er a try. `irb` `1 + 1`
